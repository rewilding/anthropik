This repo is meant to contain an easily readable version of the Anthropik rewilding theses. Since those are using very basic formatting, markdown is appropriate to preserve the content for the ages. 

Notes
=====

1. This uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io) for generating html from the markdown content.
2. The generated [public](/public) content is meant to be transferred using something like `scp` over to the static directory served on [rewild.com](http://rewild.com).
