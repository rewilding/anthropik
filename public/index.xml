      <title>Thesis #14: Complexity is subject to diminishing returns</title>

      <description>Joseph Tainter&amp;rsquo;s 1988 *The Collapse of Complex Societies* remains the definitive work in the field of collapse. Tainter reviews other explanations of collapse&amp;ndash;including economics, invasion and environmental problems&amp;ndash;and finds them all insufficient. While these factors certainly play their roles, these are also the very same stressors that complexity is *supposed* to deal with. Thus, while these might suffice as proximate causes, it only underlines the ultimate cause all the more.</description>

      <title>Thesis #13: Civilization always pursues complexity</title>

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;civilization&amp;rdquo;? When asked this question directly, many people answer that a civilization is simply a synonym for &amp;ldquo;society&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;that a civilization is simply a group of people living together. This definition is betrayed when you press the point with borderline examples. Are you comfortable with the phrase &amp;ldquo;Inuit Civilization&amp;rdquo;? Or &amp;ldquo;!Kung Civilization?&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;Australian Aborigine Civilization&amp;rdquo;? Most people are not. There is no doubt as to whether the Inuit, !</description>

      <title>Thesis #12: Civilization must always grow</title>

      <description>Two suspects A, B are arrested by the police. The police have insufficient evidence for a conviction, and having separated both prisoners, visit each of them and offer the same deal: if one testifies for the prosecution (turns King&amp;rsquo;s Evidence) against the other and the other remains silent, the silent accomplice receives the full 10-year sentence and the betrayer goes free. If both stay silent, the police can only give both prisoners 6 months for a minor charge.</description>

      <title>Thesis #11: Hierarchy is an unnecessary evil</title>
      <link>http://rewild.com/anthropik/hierarchy-is-an-unnecessary-evil/</link>

      <description>Egalitarianism is an essential part of human nature; it is the very thing that led to our humanity, and remains an undeniable yearning in the human spirit that continues to shape our political fortunes (*see* thesis #7. Hierarchy is the antithesis of that, and thus, we cannot avoid the inescapable conclusion that hierarchy itself is dehumanizing and maladapted to the human condition. It appears to suit many of our closest primate relatives just fine (chimpanzees, for example), but it denies the very thing that created us as a unique species&amp;ndash;our egalitarianism.</description>

      <title>Thesis #10: Emergent elites led the Agricultural Revolution</title>
      <link>http://rewild.com/anthropik/emergent-elites-led-the-agricultural-revolution/</link>

      <guid>http://rewild.com/anthropik/emergent-elites-led-the-agricultural-revolution/</guid>
      <description>*How the Agricultural Revolution happened is well understood. It is perhaps best explained by David Rindos&amp;rsquo; Selectionist Hypothesis, which Jared Diamond explained succinctly in Guns, Germs and Steel* as a specific case of co-evolution. We could domesticate large herd mammals by identifying the leader; we could domesticate cereal grains because they were prone to harvesting. In the wild, a pea pod that doesn&amp;rsquo;t explode will simply die off, but to a human gatherer, such a pod filled with delicious peas is much more desirable than picking individual peas off the ground.</description>

      <title>Thesis #9: Agriculture is difficult, dangerous and unhealthy</title>

      <description>The previous thesis glossed over a number of significant points, which we must now go back and revisit in greater detail. The most glaring of these glosses is probably the assertion that agriculture is a risky, marginal and difficult means of acquiring food. Many readers would certainly object that agriculture provides a stable, secure and reliable source of food. After all, it was the bounty of agriculture that allowed us to give up hunting and gathering, constantly wandering and wondering where our next meal would come from, giving us the time to build civilization.</description>

      <title>Thesis #8: Human societies are defined by their food</title>

      <description>Yehudi Cohen&amp;rsquo;s 1974 *Man in Adaptation* is the kind of classic that made its case so well, no one ever reads it. Most introductory anthropology textbooks will devote an entire chapter to Cohen&amp;rsquo;s framework&amp;ndash;a framework that modern anthropology simply takes for granted. Cohen divided the world&amp;rsquo;s cultures into any one of five &amp;ldquo;adaptive strategies&amp;rdquo;: foraging, horticulture, pastoralism, agriculture, and industrialism. Cohen noted the strong correlations these strategies had with the rest of their culture; so strong that, simply given a society&amp;rsquo;s mode of subsistence, accurate predictions could often be made about their level of political complexity, their kinship patterns, their population size and density, their modes of warfare, and even their religious beliefs.</description>

      <title>Thesis #7: Humans are best adapted to band life</title>

      <description>As we saw in the previous thesis, the division between our genus, Homo, and the Australopithecines occurred two million years ago, with *H. habilis* and his freakishly large brain. All primates have brain-to-body mass ratios that are much higher than normal, but the human ratio is remarkable even among primates. According to a study from the University of Liverpool, that disproportionately high brain-to-body mass ratio is determined by the size and complexity of their social groups.</description>

      <title>Thesis #6: Humans are still Pleistocene animals</title>

      <description>In 1833, Charles Lyell introduced the name “Holocene,” or “Recent Whole,” for our current geological epoch, stretching back only 10 or 12 thousand years. This makes the Holocene an incredibly young geological epoch, the shortest by far. The International Geological Congress in Bologna adopted the term in 1885, and it has been the accepted terminology ever since. The preceding geological epoch was the “last ice age,” the Pleistocene. It lasted for two million years, and while it was marked by significantly advanced glaciation, this was not the unremitting state of affairs.</description>

      <title>Thesis #5: Humans are neither good nor evil</title>

      <description>Are humans essentially good, or essentially evil? This is one of the most basic, perennial questions in philosophy. Many identify our individual answers to this question as determing our political spectrum–conservatives believe humans are inherently evil, and require strict rules to make them good, while liberals believe humans are inherently good, and must simply be free to act on such goodness. Both positions are unrealistic. Humans are products of evolution, and evolution is unconcerned with such abstractions as “good” or “evil.</description>

      <title>Thesis #4: Human population is a function of food supply</title>

      <description>Thomas Malthus was one of the most influential thinkers of all time. His father knew Hume and Rousseau, and his own paper–*An Essay on the Principle of Population*–forever changed the way we think about populations and food supplies. It has informed food security policies worldwide, and provided the basic underpinnings of our modern concern with overpopulation. In The Origin of Species, Darwin called his theory of natural selection an application of the doctrines of Malthus in an area without the complicating factor of human intelligence.</description>

      <title>Thesis #3: Humans are products of evolution</title>

      <description>As we saw in the second thesis, natural selection is a tautology: anything that possesses some trait that makes it more likely to propogate itself, is more likely to propogate itself. Played out over a sufficiently long timeline, this can easily explain the origin of species. It was an explosive idea; not because it was theoretically lacking, nor even for lack of evidence. It was not even explosive for what it ruled out.</description>

      <title>Thesis #2: Evolution is the result of diversity</title>

      <description>The concept of progress is actually rather new. Most prehistoric and ancient peoples saw history as a constantly repeating cycle, incompatible with any notion of advancement or degradation. The first conceptions of linear time are found only in the historical era. Confuscius, the Greeks and the Jews all believed that the world was, in fact, becoming worse. In this, they did concieve of history as linear, but as the opposite of progress.</description>

      <title>Thesis #1: Diversity is the primary good</title>
      <link>http://rewild.com/anthropik/diversity-is-the-primary-good/</link>

      <description>Humans are social animals, and also capable of abstract, independent thought. The combination requires some form of social standards. Bees think with a single hive mind, and solitary animals do not encounter one another often enough to require a rigid system of morality and ethics. Without social norms, however, human society would break down. We have evolved in such societies, and require other humans to live. A single human, on his own, has little chance of survival.</description>
